# Workspace

Workspace is the progressive web app derived from Zimo Web, utilizing its latest Windows framework. It offers a streamlined web workspace experience for various tasks.

## Installation

To install the PWA offline, run `build.py` to create a static build of the website from the source code. These scripts require `node` and `npm`.

The `github-release.py` is specifically used to automatically create releases on GitHub and upload the latest build at time. This script requires a valid GitHub API token in the `.env.local` file.
